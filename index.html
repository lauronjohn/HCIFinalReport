        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Our Real-Time Face Attendance System was developed to streamline attendance recording in academic and industrial settings, addressing the inefficiencies of traditional roll call or sign-in methods. Initial user research revealed common problems in existing attendance systems, such as time consumption and inaccuracies, leading to the motivation behind our solution. The system utilizes facial recognition technology to identify individuals quickly and accurately, marking their attendance in real-time.</p>

        <p>The development process included designing and prototyping, where we used Ageitgey’s face recognition API for facial feature extraction and comparison with data stored in Firebase. User interaction with the system was straightforward, involving approaching the webcam, waiting for face detection, and automatic attendance marking. The physical design was informed by surveys and feedback from students and teachers, leading to a user-friendly interface.</p>

        <p>Our evaluation through testing on university campus showed that the system was effective, user-friendly, and highly learnable, with positive feedback from participants. Looking ahead, we plan to enhance security features, implement 'express registration,' and conduct broader tests to ensure the system’s reliability and inclusivity across various user groups. This innovative approach marks a significant shift in everyday attendance recording procedures, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in both educational and professional environments.</p>

        <h2>User Research and Requirement Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Motivation: </h3>
        <p>In many schools and workplaces, keeping track of who is present is usually done by hand or with simple computer systems. This old-fashioned way can lead to mistakes, take a lot of time, and be inefficient. People might sign in for their friends (called "buddy punching"), and it's a lot of work to keep track of everyone's attendance. Also, these methods don't give quick updates or detailed information about how often students or employees are actually there.</p>
        <h3>Solution: </h3>
        <p>Our Real-Time Face Attendance System is made to solve such common problem. It uses a camera to recognize people's faces to mark them as present. This makes the whole process faster, more accurate, and easier. It updates attendance records right away and keeps all the information in one place. This way, users such as teachers or managers can quickly see if someone is missing a lot of days and do something about it. For example, a school administrator might want to utilize our face attendance system so that they can accurately track and monitor student attendance to see who goes and doesn’t go to class. Similarly, a human resources manager in a company might want to utilize our system to automate employee attendance tracking and eliminate the need for time cards so that they can generate more accurate attendance reports for payroll purposes. </p>
        <h3>System and User Requirements: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Our system will accurately and efficiently recognize people’s faces to mark their attendance to ensure convenience and satisfaction for the end-users.</li>
            <li>The system implements an intuitive and user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate for administrators, employees, or any users interacting with our system.</li>
            <li>It stores the user’s personal data such as name, id, major, etc for front-end interface usage and feedback.</li>
            <li>The system should generally be used in a professional environment such as a school, event venue, or a company, where attendance checking is critical. </li>
            <li>It is responsive and provide immediate feedback to users when capturing facial features, recognizing faces, or logging attendance. In this way, it will help users confirm that the system is functioning correctly and provide assurance that attendance is being accurately recorded.</li>
            <li>The types of technologies that our system should generally be run on is any computer system with a camera.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Design and Prototyping</h2>
        <h3>(1) Conceptual Design and Development- How will the RFAS perform and how does it work?</h3>
        <p>The way our system implements facial recognition and attendance logging is, first, the system captures live video footage of individuals approaching the proximity of the environment and camera. Then, it detects and extracts the facial features from each frame of the video using computer vision algorithms in Ageitgey’s face recognition API. Once the facial features are extracted, the system compares them to Firebase (a real-time database) that stores the data of known faces. This comparison helps identify and recognize individuals in real-time. The system then logs the attendance of each recognized person.</p>
        <img src="/Picture1.png" alt="picture1">
        <h4>Standard interaction procedure for users using our Face Attendance System: </h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Program is initiated with the webcam turned on. The interface will display a status of “active” to indicate that the program is currently active and waiting to detect faces.</li>
         <li>User approaches the webcam </li>
        <li>User stays still and waits for the program to detect and process their face</li>
        <li>The green target will change color to red as an indication to the user that their face has been detected.</li>
        <li>A “loading” bar is displayed while the program compares their face to the known facial data stored in Firebase</li>
        <li>End-User is determined as “marked” and their attendance is recorded into the database.</li>
        <li>The user’s information as well as their updated attendance status is displayed on the program “marked” and “attended”. </li>
        <li>User exit the camera proximity</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="/Picture2.png" alt="picture2" width="700" height="400">
        
        <h3>(2) Implementation (Code-Focused)</h3>
        <p>For the implementation of the user interface, we coded it using the python programming language and the Pycharm IDE. During our coding process, we followed the basic set-up procedure to implement the logic, design, and function behind our face attendance system: </p>
        <img src="/Picture3.png" alt="picture3">
        <h4><u>Here are brief descriptions for each procedure in the diagram</u></h5>
            <p>1-Import parameters and run the webcam for face detection.</p>
            <p>2-Add graphics to create an interface showing the status of face detection (e.g., active loading).</p>
            <p>3-Generate encodings for each student’s face once to enable comparison during attendance marking (encodings need to be created again when adding new students). </p>
            <p>4-Utilize facial recognition using OpenCV and import the necessary libraries such as numpy, v2, and facial_recognition.</p>
            <p>5-Set up a Firebase database for storing and retrieving information in real-time.</p>
            <p>6-Convert the personal user data (id, name, major, etc) into JSON format in order to send and update it into Firebase</p>
            <p>7-Create a Bucket for images in the same file used for running encodings so that all the images will be automatically uploaded to Firebase while generating encodings. </p>
            <p>8-Fetch the data from Firebase and add it to graphics.</p>
            <p>9-Check whether already marked</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>Since this is a Human-Computer interaction based project, we have not covered the in-depth coding details about our program. Rather, we will discuss and evaluate the user interaction and experience when utilizing our Face attendance system in order to observe in what ways our product was successful and unsuccessful in the prototype and implementation phase. In this way, we have also showcased the iterative design principle in order to learn what we can improve in our system for future works. For further comprehension, you can refer to the source code of our project which is located in the <b>Appendix</b>.</i></p>

            <h3>(3) Physical Design (text, interaction styles, end-user interface)</h3>
            <p>The development that led to the physical design of our system began with a rough sketch and a poll prototype survey of the design interface. Then, we gathered the results of the votes to determine which design to implement into the interface. Additionally, we also created a short-answer survey and gave it to some students and teachers in Wuhan University to gather data about their familiarity with face recognition technology and as well as feedback on expectations and needs in regards to attendance systems. There were a few suggestions for improvements from these participants that were taken into account for the final design.</p>

        <h2>Evaluation and Results</h2>
        <p>Closely monitoring the effectiveness of our Real-Time Face Attendance System, we conducted a test on our university campus to evaluate its accuracy and user-friendliness in recording attendance. Three individuals, unfamiliar with our system, participated in this test. They were tasked with using the facial recognition technology at a specific location where our system's camera was set up.</p>
        <p>Each participant approached the camera individually, activating the system, which then began the facial recognition process. We carefully observed how these first-time users interacted with the system, noting their ease of use and any potential challenges. Two team members were present during the test: one monitored the interaction and the other verified the data recorded in the real-time database.</p>
        <p>The results were positive across all participants. The system accurately recognized each person and immediately updated their attendance status in the database, showcasing its efficiency. The participants found the process straightforward, reflecting the system's high learnability and minimal error rate. Their feedback emphasized the system's quick response and the simplicity of the process.</p>
        <p>Encouraged by these promising initial results, we're planning more comprehensive tests with a larger and diverse group of users. These future tests aim to delve deeper into the system's performance in various scenarios and provide more extensive data on its overall usability and user experience.</p>

                <td>Answer: "I'd like the facial recognition attendance system to be very straightforward and user-friendly. When I enter a building, I envision there should be a screen with a camera set up at the entrance. As I walk in, the camera would quickly and accurately recognize my face without me having to stop or pose. The system should then instantly mark and update my attendance. I think the system should work efficiently even during peak hours when multiple people are entering. Also, for privacy, I'd prefer if the system only stores minimal necessary data and ensures it's securely handled."</td>

                <td>Answer: "Yes, there are a few features I'd expect in a real-time face attendance system. Firstly, it should provide immediate updates; as soon as someone is marked present, it should give feedback and reflect in the system without delay. Easy access to attendance records is also crucial, not just for teachers but for students to view their own attendance history. I'd also expect a high level of accuracy in face detection to avoid any errors in marking attendance. Moreover, the system should be able to handle different lighting conditions and recognize faces with minor changes, like new hairstyles or glasses.”</td>
